Brief overview of program, including any known bugs:
In this assignment, my goal was to create, document, and 
implement a new class called Ball. The techniques that I used 
were defining a new class, managing instance variables, and
defining behaviors through class methods. The goal of the Ball 
class is to simulate the movement of a ball under the effects 
of gravity.
